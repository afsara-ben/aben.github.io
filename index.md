## About Me

Hello! My name is Afsara Benazir. I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Felix Xiaozhu Lin](https://fxlin.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/) (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) in 2021. 

For more information, please check my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bzx6RR0E4NC9gQ4YAzODydJnvjALcVKD/view?usp=sharing).
